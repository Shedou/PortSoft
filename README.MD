# PortSoft v0.3

## BASIC RULES

1) Portable independent software is preferred.

2) Directory Structure: `/PORTSOFT_FOLDER / ARCHI_FOLDERS / program_folder`

`PORTSOFT_FOLDER` - Main folder.

`ARCHI_FOLDERS` - Software "categories", for example x86/x86_64/script/other.

`program_folder` - Folder with a specific program, for example ChimbaBench.

### SYSTEM
